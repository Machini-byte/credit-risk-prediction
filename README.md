Credit Risk Prediction: Identifying Defaulters with Machine Learning

🚀 Predicting Credit Default Risk with Logistic Regression & SMOTE
📈 Accuracy: 67% | AUC: 0.71 | Avg Precision: 0.49

## Overview

This project tackles credit risk prediction a critical challenge in banking and finance by leveraging Logistic Regression and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle class imbalance. The model predicts whether a borrower will default (high risk) or repay (low risk), helping financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions.

## Why This Matters
🔹 Banks lose billions annually due to loan defaults.

🔹 Traditional risk models often fail to detect subtle patterns in imbalanced datasets.

🔹 My solution improves prediction fairness by addressing class imbalance with SMOTE, increasing model reliability.

## Key Achievements

✅ Handled severe class imbalance using SMOTE, improving minority class recall.

✅ Achieved 67% accuracy and AUC of 0.71, outperforming baseline models.

✅ Optimized precision-recall trade-off (Avg Precision: 0.49) to reduce false approvals of high-risk borrowers.

✅ Delivered interpretable results with Logistic Regression coefficients, aiding business decisions.
